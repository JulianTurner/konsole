# Konsole.Tests.Sandbox

Sandbox to move test code to, so that the samples project can be not messed with and the samples can be curated to be helpful documentation.

Currently the samples are a mess, because I keep hijacking the samples to do integration testing and forgetting to restore the test code, doh!
